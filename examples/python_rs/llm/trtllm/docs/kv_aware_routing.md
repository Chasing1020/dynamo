# KV Aware Routing

This document describes how to use the KV aware routing feature in Dynamo with TensorRT LLM serving.

The KV Router is a component that aggregates KV Events from all the workers and maintains a prefix tree of the cached tokens. It makes decisions on which worker to route requests to based on the length of the prefix match and the load on the workers.

## KV Aware Routing with Monolithic Serving

Follow the instructions in the [README](../README.md) to setup the environment for [monolithic serving](../README.md#monolithic-deployment).

### 1. Workers

For KV aware routing to work, we need to launch multiple workers. To do this, you can use the following command for each worker:

```bash
cd /workspace/examples/python_rs/llm/tensorrt_llm/
# For 2 workers
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 mpirun --allow-run-as-root -n 1 --oversubscribe python3 -m monolith.launch --publish-stats --publish-kv-cache-events --engine_args llm_api_config.yaml 1>worker1.log 2>&1 &
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 mpirun --allow-run-as-root -n 1 --oversubscribe python3 -m monolith.launch --publish-stats --publish-kv-cache-events --engine_args llm_api_config.yaml 1>worker2.log 2>&1 &
```

Note the extra arguments `--publish-stats` and `--publish-kv-cache-events` to publish the stats and kv cache events from the workers for effective routing.
The config file [llm_api_config.yaml](../llm_api_config.yaml) specifies extra configuration for the LLM execution engine to support stats and kv cache events collection. These configurations are:
1. `enable_iter_perf_stats` in `pytorch_backend_config` to enable the iteration performance stats collection.
2. `event_buffer_max_size` in `kv_cache_config` to specify the maximum number of events that can be stored in the buffer.
3. `enable_block_reuse` in `kv_cache_config` to enable the block reuse feature for improved performance.

### 2. Router

To launch the router, run the following command:

```bash
cd /workspace/examples/python_rs/llm/tensorrt_llm/
python3 -m monolith.router --min-workers 2 --engine_args llm_api_config.yaml --routing-strategy prefix 1>router.log 2>&1 &
```

Note the extra argument `--min-workers 2` to specify the minimum number of workers to wait for before starting the router.
The router will schedule requests to the workers based on the stats and kv cache events. If KV aware routing is not enabled, the router will schedule requests to the workers in a random manner.

Create HTTP endpoints for the router:
```bash
llmctl http add completion TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0 dynamo.router.completions
```

### 3. Send Requests

Follow the instructions in the [README](../README.md#send-requests) to send requests to the [HTTP server](../README.md#http-server).


## KV Aware Routing with Disaggregated Serving

Follow the instructions in the [README](../README.md) to setup the environment for [disaggregated serving](../README.md#disaggregated-deployment).
All of the steps remain the same except launching the [workers and the router](../README.md#workers).

### 1. Workers

To launch the workers and the router, run the following command:

```bash
cd /workspace/examples/python_rs/llm/tensorrt_llm/
mpirun --allow-run-as-root --oversubscribe -n 5 python3 -m disaggregated.worker --publish-stats --publish-kv-cache-events --engine_args llm_api_config.yaml -c disaggregated/llmapi_disaggregated_configs/single_node_kv_aware_config.yaml 1>disagg_workers.log 2>&1 &
```

The config file [single_node_kv_aware_config.yaml](disaggregated/llmapi_disaggregated_configs/single_node_kv_aware_config.yaml) specifies extra configuration for the LLM execution engine to support stats and kv cache events collection. These configurations are:

Note: The configuration also specifies 4 context servers and 1 generation server.

### 2. Disaggregated Server

To launch the disaggregated server, run the following command:

```bash
cd /workspace/examples/python_rs/llm/tensorrt_llm/
python3 -m disaggregated.server --engine_args llm_api_config.yaml --routing-strategy prefix 1>disagg_server.log 2>&1 &
```

### 3. Send Requests

Follow the instructions in the [README](../README.md#send-requests) to send requests to the [HTTP server](../README.md#http-server).


## Known Issues
- KV aware routing is not supported for chat endpoint.
- For disaggregated deployment, kv aware routing is only supported for context server completion endpoints.
