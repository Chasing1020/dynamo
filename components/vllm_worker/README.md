# VLLM Worker


Examples:

| [Single Worker](#example-1-standalone-worker) | [8 Workers with KV Routing](#example-3-kv-cache-aware-router--8-workers) | [Prefill + Decode](#example-4-1-prefill-and-1-decode-disaggregation-tp-1) | [Prefill TP1 DP 4 Decode TP 4 DP 1](#example-6-4-prefill-and-1-decode-disaggregation-prefill-tp-1-decode-tp-4-with-kv-aware-routing) |

## Description

The vllm worker integrates the vllm MQLLMEngine into dynamo and
extends its capabilities with support for:

- Disaggregated Serving
- KV Aware Routing

## Details
- **Package Name**: `dynamo.components.vllm_worker`
- **Version**: `0.1.0`
- **Dependencies**: `ai-dynamo`
- **Input/Output**: Open AI chat/completions

## System Diagram

This figure shows an overview of the major components for deploying a
vllm worker in a dynamo graph with all features.

```

## Usage Examples

### Pre-Requisites

The following examples require that you have:

1. Cloned the dynamo repo
2. Built dynamo development container.
3. Launched the container on a system with NVIDIA GPU

#### Cloning the Dynamo Repo

```
git clone https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo.git
cd dynamo
git checkout nnshah1-dynamo-llm
```

#### Building Environment

This command builds an environment supporting vllm.

```
./container/build.sh
```

### Example 1: Standalone Worker

#### System Diagram

```
  +------+      +------------------+
  | HTTP |----->| Monolithic Worker|
  |      |<-----|                  |
  +------+      +------------------+

```

#### Command

Note the following command launches the supporting services when
designated as the "leader" (default).

```
./solutions/dynamo_llm/scripts/dynamo_llm_launch.sh -- --model 'deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B'
```

#### Request

In a seperate terminal use curl to exercise the endpoint:

```
curl localhost:8181/v1/chat/completions   -H "Content-Type: application/json"   -d '{
    "model": "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B",
